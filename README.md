## My process

### Built with

This is the first project I will build with Bootstrap 5. The most fascinating part of this project is the responsiveness to various devices made easy by the custom components and classes. I used Bootstrap flex-box to arrange the row, even added how it should the items contained in a flex to display when showed on a mobile device. WOW, I am fired up for the next projects. I also used the semantic HTML5 markup also.

I got stuck while trying to implement the navigation. It was the most difficult part of the project, I tried to make it look like the one given in the template. It was quite difficult.

### What I learned

I learned how implement what I learnt in the Bootstrap 5 tutorial. It was quite interesting.

### Continued development

I will like to focus more on the navigation aspect and building more high-fidelity websites.
